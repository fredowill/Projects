        @Override
        public int hashCode() {

            int radix;
            return Character.digit(this.toString(), radix);

        }

  I don't understand the first part of the homework, and the second is based of the first.
  the hw tells us to use "Character.digit" but am I suppoesed to make radix assigned to a value? is radix just some random
  constant.
